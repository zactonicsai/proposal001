Here's a complete step-by-step guide to create Azure Blob Storage:

## Step 1: Sign in to Azure Portal
1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your Azure account credentials
3. If you don't have an Azure account, you'll need to create one first

## Step 2: Create a Storage Account
1. In the Azure portal, click **"Create a resource"** (+ icon) in the top-left corner
2. Search for **"Storage account"** in the marketplace
3. Select **"Storage account"** from the results
4. Click **"Create"**

## Step 3: Configure Basic Settings
Fill out the **Basics** tab:

**Project Details:**
- **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
- **Resource Group**: Choose existing or create new (e.g., "my-storage-rg")

**Instance Details:**
- **Storage account name**: Enter a unique name (3-24 characters, lowercase letters and numbers only)
  - Example: `mystorageaccount2024`
- **Region**: Choose your preferred location (e.g., "East US")
- **Performance**: 
  - **Standard** (for general purpose, cost-effective)
  - **Premium** (for high-performance scenarios)
- **Redundancy**: Choose based on your needs:
  - **LRS** (Locally Redundant Storage) - cheapest
  - **GRS** (Geo-Redundant Storage) - recommended for production
  - **ZRS** (Zone-Redundant Storage)
  - **GZRS** (Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage)

## Step 4: Configure Advanced Settings (Optional)
In the **Advanced** tab, you can configure:
- **Security**: Enable secure transfer, blob public access
- **Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Enable if needed for big data analytics
- **Blob storage**: Configure access tier (Hot, Cool, or Archive)

For basic blob storage, default settings are usually fine.

## Step 5: Configure Networking (Optional)
- **Public endpoint**: Allow access from all networks (default)
- **Private endpoint**: For enhanced security (advanced)

## Step 6: Configure Data Protection (Optional)
- **Recovery**: Enable soft delete for blobs and containers
- **Tracking**: Enable versioning and change feed if needed

## Step 7: Configure Encryption (Optional)
- Default encryption settings are usually sufficient
- You can configure customer-managed keys if required

## Step 8: Add Tags (Optional)
- Add tags for organization and billing purposes
- Example: Environment=Dev, Project=WebApp

## Step 9: Review and Create
1. Click **"Review + create"**
2. Review all your settings
3. Click **"Create"**
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

## Step 10: Create a Container (Blob Container)
After your storage account is created:

1. Go to your new storage account
2. In the left menu, under **Data storage**, click **"Containers"**
3. Click **"+ Container"** at the top
4. Configure container settings:
   - **Name**: Enter container name (lowercase, no spaces)
     - Example: `images`, `documents`, `uploads`
   - **Public access level**:
     - **Private** (no anonymous access) - recommended
     - **Blob** (anonymous read access for blobs only)
     - **Container** (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)
5. Click **"Create"**

## Step 11: Upload Your First Blob
1. Click on your newly created container
2. Click **"Upload"** button
3. Select files from your computer
4. Optionally configure:
   - **Blob type**: Block blob (default for most files)
   - **Block size**: Leave default
   - **Access tier**: Hot, Cool, or Archive
5. Click **"Upload"**

## Step 12: Get Connection Information
To use your blob storage programmatically:

1. Go to your storage account
2. In the left menu, click **"Access keys"**
3. Copy either:
   - **Connection string** (easiest for applications)
   - **Storage account name** and **Key** (for REST API)

## Step 13: Configure Access (Optional)
For programmatic access, you can also create:

**Shared Access Signature (SAS):**
1. Go to **"Shared access signature"** in the left menu
2. Configure permissions and expiration
3. Generate SAS token

**Access Policies:**
1. Go to your container
2. Click **"Access policy"**
3. Add stored access policies for better management

## Verification
You now have:
- ✅ Azure Storage Account
- ✅ Blob Container
- ✅ Access credentials
- ✅ First blob uploaded (optional)

Your blob storage is ready to use! You can now access it via:
- Azure portal (manual management)
- REST API (programmatic access)
- Azure Storage SDKs (various programming languages)
- Azure Storage Explorer (desktop application)

The URL format for your blobs will be:
```
https://{your-storage-account}.blob.core.windows.net/{container-name}/{blob-name}
```

Here's a detailed explanation of each Azure Blob Storage option and when to use them:

## Performance Tiers
